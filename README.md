   React <br>Countries Dashboard
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a Countries Dashboard Project built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong> and <strong><em>Material-UI</em></strong>
  <br><br> 
	 This project is about building a dashboard that connects to an open-source API has information about all countries in the world, gets the data from the API, and displays it in a well-formatted table.

Then we should be able to apply 1 level of filter to this data.

First level: Search Filter:<br>
Where we can search in the countries name or capital or region and display only the countries which have the search term in their name or capital or regions.
